Have the alerts been addressed for this campaign?

Is autobonus setup? Can we set up autobonus?

Is Regulus goal aggressive enough?

Pixel splitting is not expected to benefit this campaign (if there is a universal pixel placed)

Is cost an issue? Should min margin be lowered or max margin be implemented? Should we increase max autobonbus?

The model has learned retargeting

Would this campaign benefit from manual contextual, BT, or retargeting tactics?

Pixels
Pixels are firing consistently, with adequate volumes, and on the proper pages

Pixel fairness is not an issue

Models
Model calibration is good (add Jessica's lines)

Is the campaign on the right model?

We have enough training data

If calibration accuracy < 75% and AUC > 75%, consider making target goal less aggressive

If calibration accuracy > 75%, consider using autobonus to better control performance and margin

If calibration accuracy < 75% and cpm_bid < 0, increase max autobonus % (where available)

Ads & Publishers
Are ads running & clicking through properly?

Are there too many ads per ad size? Do the ads make sense? Is call to action clear?

Is click through URL to a page that aligns with client goals?

Attribution & External Reporting
If attribution is poor, lower click & view windows

Looking at a client external report, does it properly align with Apollo?
